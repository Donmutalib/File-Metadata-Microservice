# File Metadata Microservice

## Motivation
It can be used with any shopping project needing JSON products. This project incorporates filtering capabilities using django-filter. Django-filter is a generic, reusable application to alleviate writing some of the more mundane bits of view code.

### Goal
The goal with drf-ecommerce-api is to provide a client user with e-commerce JSON data and allow users to filter based on a model’s fields, displaying the form to let them do this.

⚙️ Installation

## Other usage examples
You can submit a form that includes a file upload.

When you submit a file, you receive the file name, type, and size in bytes within the JSON response.
